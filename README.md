In the [research](https://raspad.network/home/pyat-proektov-budushhego-razgovory-s-aktivistkami-naczionalnyh-dekolonialnyh-dvizhenij/) presented below, we tried to understand the existing infrastructures of connectivity (using Telegram channels) among national movements, indigenous rights movements, and emerging structures that develop, use, and support ideas of disintegration and decolonization of the rf.

Many new channels, prominent networks, and groups have emerged after russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. These groups develop ideas of decolonization, federalization, and regional separatism. These ideas are not always interconnected and do not always stem from one another. We think it is essential to understand what is happening at the margins of the interactions between these narratives and how and on what grounds these groups interact.
