What do we see on the arms and components supply map?

Erased borders.

Hybrid regimes of map blurring by transnational capitals and neocolonial logics of subordination.

Flexible modulation of transnational military contractors' command networks in a state of permanent war.

Networks of a global empire of military concerns and their cross-national connectedness.

Networks materialize their boundaries through the detailing of connections, names, addresses, and nuanced logistics.

The network should be treated as a process and technology with algorithms of action but not as an object.

A worldwide war condition blurs the distinction between war and non-war, where "war becomes the basic principle of the organization of social life, and politics is only one of its instruments or embodiments" (A. Negri, M. Hardt "Empire").

Despite the apparent political autonomy of neighboring countries (former Soviet countries: Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Georgia, Moldova, etc.), russia continues to use its territorial neighbors as a transit zone to bypass the blockage of supplies of components for the military-industrial complex. The borders of sovereign territories are being re-drawn under the pressure of the diffuse space of the russian network of military contractors. Corrupt bypass routes for shadow imports become active and visible.

Shadow imports are necessary for russia to continue to replenish stocks and service the military-industrial complex.

The russian military-industrial complex is not independent and critically depends on imported components.

This is especially true for UAVs, secure communications, microelectronics, and machine tools for manufacturing parts.

The russian military-industrial complex is a direct successor of the soviet one. Over the past 30 years, very few new weapons have been put into serial production. The main focus of the russian military-industrial complex is on repair, support for the first, and modernization of what was produced during the USSR era. The new weapons samples under the russian outer shell consist of Western components at the level of engines, optics, processors, and microelectronics.

Contrary to myths about the impressive legacy of the soviet union, its own developments, and military production capacities, the russian military-industrial complex is a poorly coordinated, corrupt, and non-independent network of half-destroyed research institutes of the soviet period. Places, where import substitution of microelectronics and production methods takes place only on podiums in front of investors and in the weak imagination of officials, not existing in reality, the dynamics of the microelectronics industry and russian developments can be traced on the archived pages of the plant of Angstrem JSC ( moscow company engaged in the design and manufacture of electronic products and semiconductors. The company produced a number of Soviet-era integrated schemes. After the collapse of the USSR in the 90s, it produced a line of calculators and bank cards.) The plant, which was founded in 1963 under the name NII-336, and like the entire russian microelectronics industry, rapidly deteriorated after the collapse of the USSR 2.

2010: "The government will keep foreign parts out of defense products, cryptography, and passport systems To support russian microelectronics, the government agreed to provide local companies with orders, even if their products are more expensive than their foreign counterparts The government will support russian microelectronics" (c).

2010: "It makes no sense to create capacities for mass production of consumer electronics and electronic components with a low intellectual component, as the technological lag from the world leaders - the USA, Japan, Asia - is too great. There is nothing terrible in the fact that russia will continue to import from abroad electronics of mass demand - household appliances, TV sets, cell phones, GLONASS navigators, bank and trade cards, and other "colonial" goods (or to produce abroad for domestic consumption, but based on russian developments) - this is what all countries do today" (c).

2011: "Angstrem" started selling Huawei equipment.”

2011: "Vnesheconombank renewed Angstrem-T's credit line for 815 million euros. Former Communications Minister Leonid Reiman may have helped Angstrem-T reach an agreement with the bank.

Vnesheconombank's Supervisory Board has approved the resumption of financing for Angstrem-T, a source close to the Board told Vedomosti. The matter concerns a credit line for 815 million euros, which the bank allocated to this company in 2008 for the purchase of AMD licenses and equipment, as well as for the launch of a 0.13-0.11 micrometer microchip plant." (с)
2018: "U.S. sanctions targeting russia's nascent high-tech industry have caused a russian microchip company significant financial problems and delayed the launch of an initiative aimed at producing substitutes for Western products, the firm's owner said." President Vladimir Putin has emphasized the need to develop a domestic technology industry in russia to make it less dependent on Western equipment. But Moscow's efforts to produce russian microchips and other high-tech products have been hampered by U.S. sanctions against a number of russian technology companies. Angstrem-T, which makes semiconductors, has accumulated significant debts and is about to be taken over by state development bank VEB after failing to repay an 815 million euro loan."(c)

2019 Bankruptcy.

2023 Angstrem is placed under state management under the decree on the state defense order, enters with GC Element, a joint venture between Rostekh and AFK Sistema, and Angstrem-T goes under the control of the state-owned VEB.RF corporation

2023 disassembly into components by Ukrainian military experts: "Rashistka radio #Azart manufactured by #Angstrom. The radio contains five key #AnalogDevices chips." (c)

What do we learn here about the global supply of components for the military-industrial complex, except about the helplessness and collapse of russia's domestic microelectronics industry? The US imposed sanctions on Angstrem-T in 2016 for the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but in 2023, Angstrem-T will use microchips made in the US.

These details are also important because the Azart radio, assembled by Angstrem, is part of the Lorandit RP-377LR (radio-electronic reconnaissance) and REB (radio-electronic warfare) system, which is used in the war against Ukraine. That's being used in the war against Ukraine.  RER and REB play key roles in combat, as they read UAV signals and interfere with the piloting course of enemy UAVs.  That is, we realize that russian radio surveillance and radio warfare equipment are not without Western and Chinese manufacturers. At the same time, neither the U.S. nor the European countries provide lend-lease and aid to Ukraine.

russia does not have an extensive network of contractors for the military industry. Orders are distributed non-transparently within large holdings and corporations. Control over the fulfillment of orders is also hidden deep in the gut of an opaque but poorly coordinated machine. Since 2014, a network of foreign intermediary firms was registered and set up to supply components for the production of weapons. They, in turn, sent chips, microchips, etc., to military contractors - subsidiaries of the russian military-industrial complex, whose main enterprises were already under sanctions.

The sanctions boycott policies adopted in 2022 (and earlier in 2014) by the EU and a number of other countries no longer allow russia to obtain resources for direct warfare. However, the effect of sanctions 3 on military technology is severely weakened by the time lag, the merging of civilian and military technologies, and the enforced loyalty of the buffer countries that russia uses. Most importantly, russia continues to obtain components through old corrupt "business as a usual" relationships in European countries.

Some military logistics have been restructured to focus on production in Iran, China, and Turkey. However, Western components produced in the EU and the U.S. enter russia via Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, and Uzbekistan.
Such cooperation and assistance in circumventing sanctions can hardly be called voluntary for the countries of the former USSR that share common borders with russia.

Human resources also play an important role in the colonial logic of warfare. Taking advantage of the pressure on the former soviet republics, russia promises russian passports to migrant workers from Central Asia for their participation in the war. In 2023, russia roundups and police raids on migrants who have obtained russian passports to serve them as military conscripts. External colonial logics are reflected in domestic politics: most of russia's army is made up of indigenous peoples, residents of national republics, and contract soldiers from economically disadvantaged regions. In Alabuga (Tatarstan), 15-year-olds are forcibly recruited to assemble Iranian Shahed combat drones for the needs of the russia army. The ideas of the "russian world" are paid for by those who were consistently exploited by the central regions and experienced genocides and ethnic cleansing by the empire.

We want to emphasize that the post-Soviet countries are deliberately used by russia, as the dependent quality of relations does not create conditions for symmetrical choices or the possibility of autonomous decision-making. In the example of Sakartvelo it is easy to trace the links of colonial pressure. Suffering 20% occupation of its territories by russia, Sakartvelo does not join the EU sanctions demands, despite the high level of internal solidarity of Sakartvelo residents towards Ukraine's struggle and despite the fact that Sakartvelo became a candidate for EU accession in 2023. There are many reasons for these apparent contradictions (threat of military intervention from russia, old corrupt ties between the countries, forced cross-border cooperation, transit deals, etc).

Also, the fact that many countries of post-soviet territories are linked to russia by forced labor migration plays a role in dependency relations. Migrant families are fragmented by labor-trade relations and forced linguistic-cultural integration in russia. And russian exploitative logics is the reason for this migration. Financial, scientific, educational, and cultural resources have been concentrated around the center ( moscow) without strengthening and developing local infrastructures, which makes people migrate for the missing flows in search of work, education, health care and better quality of life. The logics of capital and colonialism follow symmetrically, supporting each other.

Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the borders of post-Soviet countries have been experiencing unrest and anxiety. Tensions have materialized into border military conflicts (Tajikistan-Uzbekistan, Armenia-Azerbaijan) and mass rallies demanding local authorities stop flirting with the Kremlin. (Armenia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Moldova).
Through external agents of influence, russia pressures and interferes in local elections, sabotaging paid rallies and riots. It threatens with economic pressure and cutting off access to energy resources, forcing neighboring countries into political deals loyal to itself.

We see diffraction and plurality in the ideas of territorial independence and state sovereignty. Logistic flows furrow and redraw political and geographical maps, subjugating new territories and redefining them. The economic dependence and connectedness of the post-soviet space with the kremlin's central apparatus, subordinates the regional territories of russia in the logic of resource economy and encroaches on the fragile borders with neighboring states. Moscow is becoming a liquid and sticky matter, expanding its presence and extending its spheres of influence into more vulnerable regions on geographic or economic grounds.

There can be no equal and secure relationship with a government that looks at a neighboring independent state as a temporarily neglected territory and does not see it as a subject of its own history. On the other hand, russia looks at the former republics in a revanchist and, at the same time, condescending way. The histories of external and internal colonial conquests, genocides, and deportations in tsarist russia, the russian empire, and modern russia are still covered with Bolshevik myths of equality and friendship of peoples and false oppositions to Western imperialism.

What is the purpose of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine by russia? A war to establish or maintain a social order may not have an end. Therefore, it involves constant, unremitting use of violence and cruelty. It cannot be won, or, more precisely, it has to be won over and over again daily. We are looking at a policy of consistent genocide and destruction of the culture of a former USSR republic that has disassociated itself from the xenophobic narratives of the "russian world.”

Russia is not interested in new territories from the point of view of their local development. (this can be traced back to the occupation of Abkhazia and the subsequent abandonment of the territories). At the same time as new territories of Ukraine are being seized, the regions of russia are rotting, numerically and economically dying out, being an exploitative and reproductive zone for the center ( moscow).

Russia does not hesitate to make temporary making to obtain weapons and organize gray oil searching for totalitarian governments such as Iran, Turkey, and Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan helps circumvent sanctions on oil and gas sales to the EU by being a hub/redistribution zone and giving russian gas and oil products for Azerbaijan's oil and gas exports. Iran and Turkey are suppliers of drones, which are then passed off as locally produced by the russia (e.g. Geranium drones used in the war with Ukraine).

Also, russia supports and legitimizes such terrorist groups as Hamas (Palestine), Taliban (Afghanistan) and expands its presence in Africa by participating in local military coups.
Analysis of the schemes and channels of supply of components for the russian military-industrial complex reveals many countries involved, in addition to the former soviet republics. russia continues to receive all necessary dual-use goods and critical elements for weapons production. China, Turkey, and Iran are also significant partners. Having developed and joined the sanctions, western European countries and the U.S. are forced not to sell parts directly, but this still does not prevent the delivery of components to russia.

Many Western companies do not answer journalists' questions about export conditions of release and how to control the use of their products.

At the moment, we see stable supply networks on the map that help circumvent sanctions controls. And if, in the case of post-soviet countries, in many respects, we can understand the situation of non-choice, then the loyalty and rigidity of the rest of the countries: the UK, the USA, and Western European countries (France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland) - raise questions. 
Questions about the boundaries of expansion and the speed of geopolitical capital military-industrial geopolitical capital.

It is not the sanctions that work poorly but their adoption mechanisms and consistent enforcement procedures.

**OVERALL NUMBERS OF RUSSIA'S IMPORTS:**

(information collected from public sources)

The main increase in exports from the EU to the countries of the former Soviet Union was for goods that fell under the anti-Russian sanctions - it amounted to 95%. Exports of these goods to Russia collapsed by 71%. For example, in November 2021, the total exports of these types of goods to Belarus, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan amounted to only €500 million, but in November 2022 they tripled to €1.5 billion.

In the last six months of 2023, Russian authorities cleared components of the U.S. Analog Devices Inc. worth more than $98 million, Xilinx - more than $75 million, Microchip Technology - more than $42 million, Texas Instruments - at least $38 million, as well as Infineon, Germany's largest semiconductor manufacturer - more than $28 million, according to customs data. Marvell (chip manufacturer) imported more than $11 million worth of products, Cypress Semiconductor - more than $3.8 million, and Atmel - more than $2.7 million.

In addition, US Intel and AMD products, including microprocessors, worth more than $169 million and $35 million, respectively, were imported into Russia.

China is Russia's largest trading partner, with its exports to Russia increasing by $8.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, according to UN Comtrade data. But in percentage terms, it is not the biggest growth: Turkey, Armenia, and Central Asian countries occupy the first five places.

According to the UK's Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies (RUSI), Russia never stopped importing Western electronics. From March to October 2022, it imported more than $2.6 billion worth of it, with almost $777 million worth of chips and components from companies such as Intel, AMD, Texas Instruments, and Analog Devices.

The analysis conducted by Euromonitor experts is even more curious. It showed that exports of goods from the European Union to Russia from March to November 2022 fell by 47%, while exports to Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan increased by 48% over the same period, RBC reported. 

Since the start of the all-out invasion of Ukraine, Russia has increased the value of imported microelectronics to $2.45 billion, up from $1.8 billion in 2021. The International Working Group on Russian Sanctions identified that at least 1,057 foreign components made by 155 companies are used in Russian weapons.

**Summary information on the COUNTRIES OF SANCTIONS AND GRAY EXPORT:** 

**KAZAKHSTAN:**

Although its government has declared neutrality in the Russo-Ukrainian war, its trade with Russia suggests otherwise. Kazakhstan has become a major channel for supplying technology to Russia and circumventing Western sanctions. Last year, Kazakhstan's imports from the EU rose 89 percent to 10.4 billion euros. This increase includes significant purchases of technology and equipment (worth about €4 billion). Some €2.6 billion worth of goods went missing, thus becoming "ghost goods" - goods that were officially purchased by Kazakhstan from the EU but never reached consumers in Central Asia.

In 2022, EU trade with Kazakhstan totaled €40.2 billion, 74% more than in 2021. EU exports totaled €10.4 billion, up 89% from 2021, while imports from Kazakhstan reached €29.8 billion (up 70% from 2021.) 2021). The trade balance amounted to €19.5 billion in favor of Kazakhstan, compared to €12.1 billion in favor of Kazakhstan in 2021.

Almost 1 billion of this amount went to machinery and engineering, although Kazakhstan does not produce most of these goods. Last year, Kazakhstan sold 3.3 million euros worth of semiconductor components to Russia, although this trade amounted to only 11,000 euros in 2021.


Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister Serik Zhuangarin, who is also the Central Asian country's minister of trade and integration, confirmed reports that Kazakhstan has exported sanctioned dual-use technology to Russian companies believed by investigative journalists to be involved in supporting Moscow's war in Ukraine. Zhuangarin said on June 27 that the Kazakh government is currently working to prevent the export of 104 types of goods to Russia, adding that controls on companies involved in such exports have been strengthened

Germany's export growth by 136% with Kazakhstan.

According to an editorial source who supplies Kazakhstan with products from China, there is a special "green" list of companies whose vehicles are not inspected: "The companies on the list are constantly changing, so it is difficult to track them down. The list is compiled, he said, by "those at the top.”

You can learn more about what is happening on the land border between Russia and Kazakhstan in this video report.More than 500 drones were sent to Russia in 2022 by the Kazakh company Aspan Arba. It was registered in Kazakhstan already after the war started - in April 2022. Industry portal Metalmininginfo reported that Aspan Arba would be the official dealer of DJI drones in Kazakhstan and will supply copters for the mining industry, "construction, power generation, search and rescue operations, and agriculture.”

According to data from Kazakhstan's Ministry of Digital Development, Defense and Aerospace Industry, Aspan Arba has received a license to import 18,000 DJI drones worth $45 million. The exporter is DJI Europe B.V., a Dutch subsidiary of the Chinese company. Five hundred drones, "Aspan Arba," sent to Russia "Heavenly Mechanics.”

"Aspan Arba" can be translated from Kazakh as "Heavenly Wagon". But it is not only the names of the Kazakh and Russian companies that are similar. "Ilya Golberg, the same name as the founder of Aspan Arba, owns Heavenly Mechanics. Mikhail Sapozhnikov, the current director of Aspan Arba, was previously co-owner of Heavenly Mechanics with Golberg. The phone numbers listed on Aspan Arba's website in the leaked data of the courier company SDEK appear to be those of an employee of Celestial Mechanics.Who else purchased drones from Celestial Mechanics?

In April 2022, drone DJI Mavic 2, with a total value of 11 million rubles from " Heavenly Mechanics," bought the Moscow regional federation of veterans of armed conflicts "Lynx". Its founder and the only board member listed on the website is Special Forces Lieutenant Colonel Andrei Mezhevykh

The largest buyer of "Heavenly Mechanics" in 2022 - early 2023 was the company " DJIay ars Moscow,” which received goods for almost 500 million rubles. " DJIay ars" under the Digbox brand sells drones and other equipment on Ozon.

In 2022 and early 2023, Elix-st sent Da Group in Kazakhstan components worth more than $800 thousand, including products from manufacturers such as Analog Devices, Infineon, Texas Instruments, and STMicroelectronics, which claim they no longer cooperate with Russia. Da Group, in turn, sends components to Russia, mainly to Stack. Thus, in January 2023, Da Group received 2,598 Onsemi brand integrated circuits from Elix-st from Germany. In the same month, 2,598 ICs from Germany were shipped by Da Group to Stack-st in Russia. At the same time, in 2018-2021, i.e., before the war, Elix-st did not import goods to Kazakhstan (and, on the contrary, imported them to Russia).

How did "Stack" get the right components?

In the suburbs of Stuttgart, one of Germany's most important industrial centers is the office of Elix-st. It is owned by Russians Evgeny and Elena Chernet. In Russia, they own a similarly named company, "Elix-M". In Kazakhstan's Astana, the company “Da Group 22” was registered in March last year. Its owner and manager is Alexander Chernet.

In 2022-2023, “Stack” was imported from Kazakhstan components (integrated circuits, diodes, transistors, and others) for 4.2 million dollars. Customs data does not contain information on which manufacturers' products it was, but there is data on the countries of origin of the goods - it is Hong Kong, Germany, the Netherlands, and Singapore.

Among Stack's clients, the website mentions the special design bureau of MPEI, a developer of radio-technical systems within Roscosmos, and the Moscow Searchlight Plant, a manufacturer of power supply systems for Russian missile systems.

Another company importing U.S. microelectronics to Russia is Russia's "Prime-Ek." In particular, it imported $3.1 million worth of components through Kazakhstan in 2022-2023. Prime-ek itself is not particularly known for anything, but it has a partner with a similar name - Prime, to which Prime-ek supplied electronic components worth more than 100 million rubles in 2022. Their offices were located in the same building, and the contact phone number listed on Prime's website appears in the leaked data of the SDEK courier service as Prime-Ek's phone number. Last year, one of Prime's largest clients was the Penza-based Elektropribor production association, part of Rostec's Avtomatika concern. It produces communications equipment for the Ministry of Defense, such as the P-240I complex, which the Russian military in Ukraine uses to communicate in the field.
But in a single day in December 2022, a Kazakhstani firm called EltexAlatau exported more than 100 shipments of dual-use electronics to Russia.

Global computer imports to Kazakhstan increased sevenfold to $1.2 billion in 2022 from the previous year, including $310 million from the EU. Meanwhile, Kazakhstan's exports to Russia in this category grew more than 2,300 times year-on-year to nearly $300 million. Meanwhile, according to UN trade data, Kyrgyzstan did not import or export a single part for airplanes, helicopters, or drones in 2021. But in 2022, Kyrgyz firms imported $3.5 million worth of such parts - mostly from the United States - and exported $1.5 million worth to Russia.
​​​​​​​
**KYRGYZSTAN:**

For 2022, total imports of goods into Kyrgyzstan increased from $5.5 billion to $9.6 billion, up 72.6% from 2021. Of these, imports of "machinery, equipment, and apparatus" increased from $770 million to $1.6 billion, or more than doubled, while exports of "machinery, equipment and apparatus" nearly doubled from $101 million to $197 million.

Russia is Kyrgyzstan's second-largest trading partner after China, accounting for 27.4% of Kyrgyzstan's total trade turnover with all countries. Kyrgyzstan's foreign trade turnover with Russia increased by 40.3% in 2022 compared to 2021, while exports from Kyrgyzstan to Russia increased by 245% from $393 million to $963 million in 2022. Russia is the largest export destination for Kyrgyzstan, with a total share of 44.1%, making Kyrgyzstan economically dependent on Russia.
Exports from Kyrgyzstan grew 250% to over $960 million. At the same time, some goods (such as rifle scopes) were not previously supplied by Kyrgyzstan to Russia.

After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, German exports to Kyrgyzstan skyrocketed 994% to 170 million euros.
For example, Kas Impuls (the first detonator plant in Central Asia) supplied 661,000 detonators to Russia from January to April 20 2023. The plant itself produced at least 19.6 thousand of them; the rest may have been shipped from China. The recipient was ORICA CIS, a member of the Evoblast Group, a Russian manufacturer of industrial explosives and initiation systems for the mining and construction industries.

None of the deliveries by Kas Impuls is reflected in the official statistics of Kyrgyzstan. It is difficult to estimate how many more such supplies have "disappeared" from the reports.

According to UN trade data, Kyrgyzstan did not import any spare parts for airplanes, helicopters and drones in 2021. But in 2022, the country imported $3.5 million worth of such products - mostly from the United States - and exported $1.5 million worth to Russia.

Kyrgyzstan exported 115,920 electric detonators worth $882,400 to Russia in 2022, although it made no shipments in 2021. Electric detonators are used in the production of anti-personnel and anti-tank mines. Kyrgyzstan, for its part, imported 193,536 electric detonators from Canada worth $3.7 million in 2022. There is reason to believe that Kyrgyzstan re-exported Canadian-made electric detonators to Russia.

Exports of military equipment for radar, radio navigation, and remote control totaled $169,800 in 2022, up 60% from 2021.
Optical sights (for weapons) exported from Kyrgyzstan to Russia in 2022 amounted to 199,700 USD, 13 times more than in 2021.
Supplies of spare parts for airplanes, helicopters and drones from Kyrgyzstan to Russia increased from zero in 2021 to $1.5 million in 2022.

**SWEDEN**

Neuronetworks for the Ministry of Defense:
The family of Roscosmos head Yuri Borisov, who previously oversaw arms procurement at the Ministry of Defense and as deputy prime minister of the government, is in control of defense contractor JSC STC Modul. In particular, the Ministry of Defense purchased a neural network gas pedal developed by NTC Modul. Modul buys electrical equipment in Switzerland, from E-tec Interconnect AG.

Swiss company CODERE continued to supply equipment to the sanctioned plant "Electromashina" in Russia, which produces components for Russian tanks. It was purchased for 155.5 million rubles through an intermediary company Galika-CTS.
GF Machining Solutions.

In 2018, JSC In 2017, the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant in Udmurtia purchased an AgieCharmilles CUT 20 P electrical discharge machine from Swiss GF Machining Solutions for 169,648 euros. https://informnapalm.org/en/how-companies-from-switzerland-italy-and-germany-help-russia-circumvent-sanctions-to-produce-weapons/

Swiss manufacturer Fritz Studer AG is also cooperating with Russia. In 2018, the company delivered two Studer S21 CNC universal cylindrical grinding machines to PJSC Kuznetsov in Samara, the largest aircraft and space engine manufacturing company in the Russian Federation. This cost more than 316 million rubles.

By order of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, Kuznetsov produces engines for Tu-160 "White Swan" strategic bombers, deeply modernized Tu-160M, Tu-95MS and long-range Tu-22M3 aircraft. The Russians are now actively using all these aircraft in the war in Ukraine.

And in 2019, the Swiss manufacturer fulfilled the order of the only company that produces missiles for S-300 and S-400 anti-aircraft systems - JSC MMZ Avangard (Moscow). Russian troops near Kharkov used these weapons - S-400 and S-300 air defense missile divisions - in April 2022.

The Russian customer received from the Swiss company a CNC precision cylindrical grinding machine with the function of machining external and internal threads S30 worth more than 382,000 euros .The Instrument Design Bureau in Tula received equipment worth more than 722 million rubles from the Swiss company GF Machining Solutions. In particular, the Russian company purchased 23 MIKRON HPM 600HD milling machines, 12 MIKRON HEM 500U milling machines, 1 AgieCharmilles FORM 20 stamping machine and a MIKRON HRM 1150U milling machine. This Russian company develops weapons. For example, the Bureau produced the Pantsir anti-aircraft missile and cannon systems, which Russia is using in its war against Ukraine.

In 2018, Swiss manufacturer Sylvac SA sold an optical measuring system model Scan 52 worth almost RUB 3 million to the russians. The customer is OJSC Novosibirsk Ammunition Plant, which produces small arms ammunition, including 7.62×51 caliber ammunition.

The Tochnost sniper rifles that the Russian National Guard was armed with in 2017 are of this caliber. According to Reuters, a special unit of the Russian National Guard called Vityaz was operating in Bucha. So, this Swiss company also contributed to the tragedy.

The director of this company is Lino Derungs, a Swiss citizen. However, he has been doing business in Russia since the early 1990s. Switzerland has long known that Galika AG is closely linked to Russia. In 2019, journalists discovered that the company was supplying equipment for the production of Kalashnikov assault rifles to Venezuela. However, Swiss officials turned a blind eye to this fact.

"In 2012, Galika AG from Volketswil in the canton of Zurich supplied machines for the production of AK-103 assault rifles worth several million Swiss francs. The plant in the city of Maracay should be up and running by the end of 2019 and will produce 25,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles per year.


The export ban did not apply to equipment sold by Galika AG. This is because the equipment did not fall under the category of military equipment and was not considered so-called dual-use goods. This refers to those machines that can be used for military purposes
